    # Install Git on your computer (laptop/PC)
    # The best way is installing SmartGit software found 
    # at https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/
    # During installation, make sure you install it for non-commercial use only.
    # Let us assume you have installed SmartGit successfully.
    
    # Visit my GitHub profile
    https://github.com/mwambaro
    # Click on the "Repositories" pane below the main Github navigation bar,
    then find the repository named "mwambaro.github.io" and click on it so as 
    to clone it.

    # Grab repository clone link by clicking 'copy'
    Link: https://github.com/mwambaro/mwambaro.github.io.git

    # Well, get the path to the git executable. On my system it is: C:\Program Files\SmartGit\git\bin\git.exe
    # To find it, open SmartGit, click on 'Edit' dropdown menu then 'Preferences'. Under 'Commands' collapsible
    # find 'Git Executable' and click it. Copy the displayed git executable path. You will use it 
    # in the git clone command shortly, again match yours or verify it is similar to mine.

    # Open your terminal (mine is Windows CMD). To open 
    # your terminal, hit "Windows + R" key combination and type "cmd", then press "Enter" key on your keyboard.
    # You should see the black terminal window on your Windows system. Run the following commands, one line 
    # at a time, making sure you wait until you are prompted for the next command.

    # Translation language name: de_DE (Germany)
    #    translated text 
    #

    #    text
    # ============================================
    # Translation language name: de_DE (Germany)
    #    translated text 

    # NOTE: Do not translate HTML tags (e.g. <div>, </div>, <a>, </a>, etc) or 
    # anything enclosed in HTML tags (e.g. <a href="#brands-div" style="text-decoration: none" class="pitch-message-modal-link">)
    # In the translated text replace the string 'locale=en_US' with 'locale=de_DE'   
    # When you are done, send the translation file (de_DE.docx) to the following email: onkezabahizi@gmail.com
